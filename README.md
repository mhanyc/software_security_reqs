# WTF (What's this for?)

Vibrant continues to invest in securing data critical to help seekers; and increasingly we are learning that we write software.

This repository contains Vibrant's development of software security requirements.  It is maintained by the InfoSec team, specifically [Eoin](https://github.com/Celtikill).

## Security Requirements

We recommend treating all requirements with a mild skepticism.  Having said that, we also enjoy (shall we say) vibrant discussion.

Please consider these a starting point for understanding general security within the context of modern software.

	> Thses are (and will likely remain indefinitely) in draft.

### Origins

InfoSec chose the latest release of [OWASP Application Security Verification Standard](https://github.com/OWASP/ASVS) as the inspiration for Vibrant's security requirements, for a variety of reasons.  Here are a few:

	- it maps directly to NIST guidelines
	- it offers tiers of requirements, allowing for variation in maturity and risk management
	- it represents consensus best-practice within a global application security community

## Usage

At least initially, these will be used by InfoSec to measure systems against a standard relevant to Vibrant's need.

As we explore our software security practice through this lens, we will work with you (dear reader) to craft [SMART](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria) requirements for your soecfic needs (together ::hearts::)
