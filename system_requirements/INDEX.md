# System Requirements

Vibrant continues to awaken to concepts of security, and the control of IT systems - and though we have started to invest (time, money, and person-power) in security, we have a long way to go.

So, these requirements should match Vibrant's consensus on achievable state-of-the-art.  If you see anything that doesn't pass the Vibrant smell test, do reach out!

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is very unlikely we meet the level 1 requirements considered 'adequate' first steps by NIST, much less level 2 or 3.
> 
> This set of requirements should be **achievable**. Consider them as possible release standards sometime in the near future and comment accordingly.
