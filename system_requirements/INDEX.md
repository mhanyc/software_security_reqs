# System Requirements

Vibrant continues to awaken to concepts of security, and the control of IT systems - and though we have started to invest (time, money, and person-power) in security, we have a long way to go.

So, these requirements should match Vibrant's consensus on achievable state-of-the-art.  Consider them as possible release standards sometime in the near future when reviewing.  If you see anything that doesn't pass the Vibrant smell test, do reach out!
